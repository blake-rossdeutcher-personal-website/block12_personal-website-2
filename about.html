            I started rock climbing at the rec center at the University of Iowa.
            After graduation, I stayed in the Chicago suburbs, where I grew up,
            before moving to North Carolina to pursue rock climbing. While
            living there, a friend brought me on trips to Colorado and New
            Hampshire to introduce me to ice. I now live in Colorado and have
            aspirations to climb to the summit of Denali in Alaska.

            I started skiing after college when I visited a friend who lived in
            Denver. Because I already knew ice skating, it was easy to learn. I
            skied in North Carolina, but it was icy. To catch some fresh pow, I
            moved to Colorado and now, I shred the gnar.

            I tried teaching myself guitar in Iowa, but never made it very far,
            so I sold it. While living in North Carolina, I bought a used guitar
            and started teaching myself. One of my friends is teaching me and I
            am very excited to learn. I played in front of other people for the
            first time at a campfire in Utah.
