          I invented electricity by putting a key on a kite. 
          It started as a weekend project and turned into something the whole world uses.

        <p>
          I invented computers working out of my garage and became the CEO of a fruit company that also happened to make computers.
          I used my invention to make a movie about sentient toys.

        <p>
          I invented the wheel working out of my cave.
          It was far more outstanding than my neighbors, Fred and Barney, who invented fire.
